    Got my webservice up and running in 1 day with no knowledge about Dancer
    whatsover.[...] Dancer is excellent for middle size websites or web services. 
    It doesn't get in your way, and supports a [...] lot of backend for deploying 
    and running your application.
    The transition from developing a prototype to having a production
    ready app is very smooth.

    Dancer is a breath of fresh air in the convoluted world of Perl web frameworks.
    I have a lot vested in CGI::Application, another fine framework, but Dancer has
    really caught my fancy for future web apps.

    I like how dancer doesn't force you to code in any specific way, it provides 
    the right amount of syntactic sugar to get your app up and running in double
    quick time - but doesn't get in the way when you want to do something else.

    It's nice and light, and can be deployed in many environments. Thumbs up from
    me!

    In the end I went with Dancer and I'm loving it so far - some more docs 
    on the idiomatic way to deal with user creation, authentication and 
    roles might be nice but I think I figured it all out pretty quickly.

    Of all the light-weight frameworks, Dancer was the nicest to
    work with when I went through to evaluate them...

    I’m really enjoying using Perl’s Dancer for building lightweight web
    applications. It’s heavily inspired by Ruby’s Sinatra framework, but clearly
    Perlish.

    Just wrapped up an eight hour scrum task in 90 minutes. I'm really 
    enjoying using Dancer. Awesome, awesome, awesome!

    Just downloaded and ran #Perl Dancer. Really curious about it. It looks
    amazing.

    @PerlDancer is the easiest way to write webapps. One day from idea to
    implemention. Fantastic work.

    For a simple framework I suggest Dancer. Great thing, it made me stop 
    hating web development.

    ...there's finally a web framework that works for me. It's called Dancer, and 
    as redundant as this might sound; Dancer, is an effortless web framework. [...]
    It took me more time studying Dancer's features and specs, than the time it 
    took for me to write the whole mini-blog app.

    I have - and would second frameworks like Perl Dancer as fantastic examples 
    of what the Perl community is up to these days.

    Perl is [...]  thriving and making some very cool new stuff
    while steadily negating the argument of being line-noise (Dancer comes to
    mind as an excellent project to both read and use).
