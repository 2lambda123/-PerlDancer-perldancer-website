    Got my webservice up and running in 1 day with no knowledge about Dancer
    whatsover.[...] Dancer is excellent for middle size websites or web services. 
    It doesn't get in your way, and supports a [...] lot of backend for deploying 
    and running your application.
    The transition from developing a prototype to having a production
    ready app is very smooth.

    Dancer is a breath of fresh air in the convoluted world of Perl web frameworks.
    I have a lot vested in CGI::Application, another fine framework, but Dancer has
    really caught my fancy for future web apps.

    I like how dancer doesn't force you to code in any specific way, it provides 
    the right amount of syntactic sugar to get your app up and running in double
    quick time - but doesn't get in the way when you want to do something else.

    It's nice and light, and can be deployed in many environments. Thumbs up from
    me!

    In the end I went with Dancer and I'm loving it so far - some more docs 
    on the idiomatic way to deal with user creation, authentication and 
    roles might be nice but I think I figured it all out pretty quickly.

    I’m really enjoying using Perl’s Dancer for building lightweight web
    applications. It’s heavily inspired by Ruby’s Sinatra framework, but clearly
    Perlish.

    ...there's finally a web framework that works for me. It's called Dancer, and 
    as redundant as this might sound; Dancer, is an effortless web framework. [...]
    It took me more time studying Dancer's features and specs, than the time it 
    took for me to write the whole mini-blog app.

    Perl is [...]  thriving and making some very cool new stuff
    while steadily negating the argument of being line-noise (Dancer comes to
    mind as an excellent project to both read and use).

    [...] the words that come to mind are "quick", "small", "simple" and "clean". 
    There's a close alignment of the packages and methods with the concepts one 
    has in mind when doing web development.
    Formerly a Perl teacher, I never taught web development to the first-year
    students because the learning curve would have been too steep. I think Dancer
    has changed the game and beginners *can* learn Perl web development using
    Dancer. (We'll find out at the beginner's class I'm giving at YAPC in Riga:)

    Perl Dancer is amazing! If you're into web development, definitely give
    Dancer a look, you might be surprised how fun and productive web development
    can be these days. Dancer is two things packed together: it stays out of
    your way if you like that, but also provides you with very powerful
    primitives to get the complex web tasks done in just a few lines of code.
    Highly recommended to both novices and experts!

    We needed to move really fast and provide a highly scalable, extensible, and
    maintainable product to our customers to enable them to pool money together.
    Using Perl Dancer and CPAN, we were able to prototype our site in a couple
    of days. That same “protoype” has evolved to the current version of the
    website over just a few weeks.

     The heavy hitters are Catalyst, Mojolicious, and Dancer. Any one of them
     can be used to build a large-scale web application just as easily as Django
     in Python, or Ruby on Rails.

     I believe so much in Dancer that I've given talks about it at local Perl

     built my next generation web services framework at Plain Black on top of
     it.

    When I picked Dancer I wasn't looking for a tool that did everything for me
    out of the box. I was looking for something I could grow into and build the
    app the way I wanted to build it. Dancer is easily extensible without
    getting in my way or limiting me, and that's a big win.

    I loved the simplicity and straight-forwardness of Dancer. It's so
    dead-simple and just gets out of your way. At a startup, you just want to
    pick tools that let you hit the ground running, and Dancer definitely gave
    us that.

    software project or piece of technology you use.
