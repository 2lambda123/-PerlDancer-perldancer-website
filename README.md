# PerlDancer Website

### Code of the perldancer.org website

This project holds the complete code of the perldancer.org website. When a push
to master is performed, this updates the code of the website.

This branch contains the new version of the website

## Specs

Here we list all the specifications collected by the team for the new website.

### Landing Page

Quoting Jason:

> I love that we showcase how easy some concepts are in Dancer right on the
> landing page. I am not sold, however, in cycling them through on the carousel.
> It would be nice if all of that content was always available without having to
> wait for it to scroll by (thatâ€™s just a personal preference though).

I agree the carousel is a bit old-fashioned, or even, annoying. A "featured"
section of real-life examples of the code could be a cood mix: letting the user
switch from one example to another, on purpose. Like blog featured articles.

### Conferences

A dedicated section for all the conferences, with videos from previous events,
schedule for conferences to come, like a "PerlDancer on Tour" page.

### Documentation

The website should provide a complete access to the documentation. Ideally,
fully indexed to be searched via a text box.

Examples of interesting websites: Angular JS or jQuery.

Ideas from Racke: why not letting the users comment on the documentation, via a
wiki method, directly on the website?

Not sure about this as it would lead to two branches for the documentaiton: the
POD and the Wiki.

See http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html which is quite a good way of introdcuing
the concepts.

### The Logo

It seems we all like it. So we'll keep it. No reason to change something we
like. But we'll refresh it a bit, and try to create smaller formats, like a
favicon.

We'll also change the 4 words around the logo, by 4 keywords of the project:
Fast, Fun, Easy, Productive.

### Dancefloor (References)

A revamp of that section, with a better, more eye-candy layout. Probably killing
the thumbnails is a good idea. It's hard to maintain and looks not that good.
Probably a simplie list is better, like Sinatrarb.com does.
